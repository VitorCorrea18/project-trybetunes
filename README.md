# Trybetunes

This project was developed during the web development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). <br>
The project is a front end music application that uses [ITunes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH3-SW1) and allow the user to listen the free 20 seconds version of Itunes songs

## Obervation
  The project could not be completed 100% in the time given, as there were much more to study and projects to be carried out,
  so the profile editing were not finished. Maybe with time i can come back to review this and implement this.
